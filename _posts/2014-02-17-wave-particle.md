_I'd modified this for my university's [Physics blog](https://physociety.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/its-a-wave-its-a-particle-its-a-wave-particle/)_.

Amateur physics enthusiasts like to question everything. One popular question is "What is light?"[^1]. Especially if they're in school and have just learnt that light is a "wave-particle". 

[^1]: If you're ever caught by one, say "the thing that comes out of a flashlight!" and run away.
