_I'd modified this for my university's [Physics blog](https://physociety.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/its-a-wave-its-a-particle-its-a-wave-particle/)_.

Amateur physics enthusiasts like to question everything. One popular question is "What is light?"[^1]. Especially if they're in school and have just learnt that light is a "wave-particle". Even the mildly disinterested chap is piqued by this. How can something be a wave and particle?

For many, this is the stepping stone to the vastly unintuitive Quantum Mechanics. By consequence, people try to convince themselves (in vain) that light if both a wave and a particle - quite literally. There are some beautiful stories spun around this concept.

The trouble with such facts is that they're misleading if you don't know what's really going on. This encourages people to ask how light knows to "change" from particle to wave and vice-versa. A more common question is, "In that case, is light **really** a wave or a particle?".

While it achieves its purpose of getting people to think about science, it fails miserably in satisfactorily answering questions. The most common "Because [fancy science term] says so" is escapism and partly incorrect in most cases. So people end up thinking that it's beyond their grasp and forget it. Or worse, brag to friends and write blog posts about their new-found knowledge :P

Before we address this question, let's quickly summarize what we know about "wave-particles" and how light "became" one. 

deBroglie's equation [^3] made it possible to assign wavelengths to particles and momenta to waves. Why did it make sense? Because it was related to the well revered Quantum Mechanics [^4].

[^1]: If you're ever caught by one, a good way to annoy them is to say "the thing that comes out of a flashlight!" and smirk.

[^2]: In QM parlance, whenever you "observe" it

[^3]: $$ \lambda = \frac{h}{p} $$ where $$ \lambda $$ is the deBroglie wavelength, $$ h $$ is the Planck constant and $$ p $$ is the momentum. 

[^4]: In QM, momentum and position are observables and conjugate variables. A well-known result of Fourier analysis is the uncertainty relation $$ \nabla x\nabla y\leq\frac{1}{2} $$ for two conjugate variables $$ x $$ and $$ y $$. This tells us that our measurements of position and momentum must not commute and is an intuitive basis for the commutation relation $$ \[x,p\]=\iota\hbar $$.
