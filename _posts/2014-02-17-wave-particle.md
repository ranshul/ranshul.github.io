_I'd modified this for my university's [Physics blog](https://physociety.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/its-a-wave-its-a-particle-its-a-wave-particle/)_.

Amateur physics enthusiasts like to question everything. One popular question is "What is light?"[^1]. Especially if they're in school and have just learnt that light is a "wave-particle". Even the mildly disinterested chap is piqued by this. How can something be a wave and particle?

For many, this is the stepping stone to the vastly unintuitive Quantum Mechanics. By consequence, people try to convince themselves (in vain) that light if both a wave and a particle - quite literally. There are some beautiful stories spun around this concept.

The trouble with such facts is that they're misleading if you don't know what's really going on. This encourages people to ask how light knows to "change" from particle to wave and vice-versa. A more common question is, "In that case, is light **really** a wave or a particle?".
