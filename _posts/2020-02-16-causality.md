"What happens *if* I travel faster than the light?" or "What was present *before* the alleged Big Bang?". Questions like these may not warrant answers. If you put the human back into the equation, if it's an excited high school science enthusiast, some people take the pain to explain why it doesn't make sense. Some people play along with the hypothetical, because who knows if the laws of physics actually are valid? They're laws, not theorems. Smug university graduates generally get a weird face in response. Not a fan of being in the receiving end of the latter case. So, I decided Google it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ *Why* exactly is that nonsensical? Is it nonsensical? Well, you get it. Also, there could be some interesting experiments like the one here - [![Non Euclidean Rendering](https://img.youtube.com/vi/kEB11PQ9Eo8/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEB11PQ9Eo8).

This needs basic ideas from set theory. For the cool kids out there, category theory.
