In my Object Oriented Programming class, I learnt about the importance of making things modular, highly cohesive [^1] and less coupled [^2]. It sounded like common sense - why wouldn't you want to organize your functions and keep things working separately? 

It took me an internship, a good Java codebase, a weird RoR codebase and a very patient project manager to understand it in real code. 

[^1]: a class performs a highly specific set of functions
[^2]: dependency between classes is less - a major change in one class should not affect the other

*[RoR]: Ruby on Rails
